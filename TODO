For Open Source Release:
  - Remove all NVIDIA Makefile code.  Need to write our own.
  - In general, fix the build so that it's sane to expect someone to be able
    to download, compile, and install Parakeet.
  - Clean up the Python front end stuff more.
  - Automate the unit testing.
  - Fix all the copyright headers and decide on an open source license (GPL2?).
